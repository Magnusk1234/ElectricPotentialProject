# ElectricPotentialProject

## Description
This project solves the **Laplace equation** to simulate the electric potential in a square, hollow 2D tube. A numerical solution will be obtained using a fourier sine series

## Theory 

\[
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \xi^2} + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \eta^2} = 0
\]
